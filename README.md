### Hi there, I'm Dr. Yaroslav O. Halchenko (AKA Dr.Yarik) ðŸ‘‹

<!--
KUDOS to @tsalo from whom I stole the idea and the initial version.
**yarikoptic/yarikoptic** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

I'm a Research Professor at the [Department of the Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College, where I am leading the [Center for Open Neuroscience](http://centerforopenneuroscience.org).
We aim to **make neuroscience a better science!**
I would invite you to visit our [Projects](http://centerforopenneuroscience.org/projects) page to discover neuroinformatics projects we are leading or involved with and see [wonderful people](https://centerforopenneuroscience.org/whoweare) I got to work with.

I try to answer questions on [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org) when I have the time, as well.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me (one of the emails in all of my commits on github). I am also `yarikoptic` on Twitter and gmail.

**Note**: my personal [github.com/yarikoptic](https://github.com/yarikoptic) does not have that many interesting repositories.
The vast majority are forks of repositories from project organizations.
There is also other portals where I host source code/and data, which might not be mirrored here:

- [hub.datalad.org](https://hub.datalad.org/) - [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org) project's hosting platform: [forgejo-aneksajo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-aneksajo/forgejo-aneksajo) fork of [forgejo](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo) with support of [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/).
- [gin.g-node.org](https://gin.g-node.org) - Neuroscience oriented code/data hosting platform: [g-node](https://github.com/G-Node/gogs) fork of [gogs](https://github.com/gogs/gogs).
- [git.oneukrainian.com](http://git.oneukrainian.com/) - primarily personal configurations: plain [git-web](https://git-scm.com/).
- [datasets.datalad.org](https://datasets.datalad.org) - DataLad's simplistic "web-ui" interface on top of many manually curated by me datasets.

DataLad datasets and some other repositories are indexed by our [registry.datalad.org](https://registry.datalad.org) if you want to search across among extracted metadata.

### Hi there, I'm Yarik ðŸ‘‹

<!--
KUDOS to @tsalo from whom I stole the idea and the initial version.
**yarikoptic/yarikoptic** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a Research Associate Professor at the [Department of the Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College, where I am leading the [Center for Open Neuroscience](http://centerforopenneuroscience.org).
I would invite you to visit our [Projects](http://centerforopenneuroscience.org/projects) page to discover neuroinformatics projects we are leading or involved with.

I try to answer questions on [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org) when I have the time, as well.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me (one of the emails in all of my commits on github). I am also `yarikoptic` on Twitter and gmail.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
